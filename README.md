# Spline-based least-squares integration for two-dimensional  shape or wavefront reconstruction
These are the demonstration codes of some similar zonal reconstruction methods with least squares in MATLAB.
Here we want to highlight the spline based least squares integration method for its application in two-dimensional shape or wavefront reconstruction.
